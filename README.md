## Description
Music store
Create a product listing app for a CD store.

As the owner of this CD store, I want to display each album that is for sale with its name, artist, price and genre.
I would like to be able to display only the albums belonging to a particular genre.
I would also like to display only the albums belonging to a particular artist.
I would like my users to be able to click a checkbox on each album to either add or remove the item to the shopping cart area of the page.
I would like my shopping cart to display the total price of all the albums I have decided to buy.
